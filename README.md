# Stock Ticker Coding Challenge

## The Goal

stockTicker.ts has code that gives a stock symbol and a price. 

What we're wanting is to build a table that lists the given stock symbols and the newest known prices. 

## What we don't want

Don't hardcode the symbols(pretend you will have no knowledge of what symbols are possible)

Don't Style too much. The goal is to see if you understand how react works not to build the best looking table.

Don't change the stockTicker.ts file

Don't use AI/copilot

## Setup

Install Node Version 22 However you like to do that

Then run

```
  npm install
  npm start
```
